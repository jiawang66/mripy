# Convolution

Convolution and its adjoint

## Concepts

Given data $x$ and fileter $d$, then the convolution of $x$ and $d$ is:

$$
y[n] = conv(x, d) = \sum_i x[n] \cdot d[i-n]
$$

## Centers

Let the shape of an array is $s$,

For python, the center of array is

$$
c = ceil(s / 2)
$$

## Adjoint with respect to data

## Adjoint with respect to filter
